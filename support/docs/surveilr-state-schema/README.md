| [behavior](behavior.md)                                           | 13      | Behaviors are configuration "presets" that can be used to drive<br>application operations at runtime. For example FS Walk behaviors<br>include configs that indicate which files to ignore, which to<br>scan, when to load content, etc. This is more convenient than <br>creating <br><br>behavior has a foreign key reference to the device table since<br>behaviors might be device-specific.                                                                                                                                                       | table |

Each time a directory is scanned for files and entries, a  record is created here. ur_walk_session has a foreign key reference to the  device table so that the same device can be used for multiple walk sessions  but also the walk sessions can be merged across workstations / servers for easier  detection of changes and similaries between file systems on different devices.                                                                    | table |

| [uniform_resource](uniform_resource.md)                           | 20      | Immutable resource and content information. On multiple executions,<br>uniform_resource are inserted only if the the content (see unique <br>index for details). For historical logging, uniform_resource has foreign<br>key references to both ur_walk_session and ur_walk_session_path<br>tables to indicate which particular session and walk path the<br>resourced was inserted during.                                                                                                                                                            | table |

| [ur_walk_session_path_fs_entry](ur_walk_session_path_fs_entry.md) | 20      | Contains entries related to file system content walk paths. On multiple executions,  unlike uniform_resource, ur_walk_session_path_fs_entry rows are always inserted and   references the uniform_resource primary key of its related content.  This method allows for a more efficient query of file version differences across  sessions. With SQL queries, you can detect which sessions have a file added or modified,   which sessions have a file deleted, and what the differences are in file contents  if they were modified across sessions. | table |
