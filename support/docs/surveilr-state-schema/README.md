| [device](device.md)                                               | 14      | Identity, network segmentation, and sysinfo for devices on which uniform_resource are found                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | table |
| [ur_walk_session](ur_walk_session.md)                             | 15      | Immutable FileSystem Walk Sessions Represents a single file system scan (or  "walk") session. Each time a directory is scanned for files and entries, a  record is created here. ur_walk_session has a foreign key reference to the  device table so that the same device can be used for multiple walk sessions  but also the walk sessions can be merged across workstations / servers for easier  detection of changes and similaries between file systems on different devices.                                                                    | table |
| [ur_walk_session_path](ur_walk_session_path.md)                   | 11      | Stores file system content walk paths associated with a particular<br>session and may have one or more root paths per session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | table |
| [uniform_resource](uniform_resource.md)                           | 20      | Records file system content information. On multiple executions,<br>uniform_resource are inserted only if the the file content (see unique <br>index for details). For historical logging, uniform_resource has foreign<br>key references to both ur_walk_session and ur_walk_session_path<br>tables to indicate which particular session and walk path the<br>resourced was inserted during.                                                                                                                                                          | table |
| [ur_walk_session_path_fs_entry](ur_walk_session_path_fs_entry.md) | 19      | Contains entries related to file system content walk paths. On multiple executions,  unlike uniform_resource, ur_walk_session_path_fs_entry rows are always inserted and   references the uniform_resource primary key of its related content.  This method allows for a more efficient query of file version differences across  sessions. With SQL queries, you can detect which sessions have a file added or modified,   which sessions have a file deleted, and what the differences are in file contents  if they were modified across sessions. | table |
