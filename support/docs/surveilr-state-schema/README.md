This could be a device file system scan or any other resource discovery  session. Each time a discovery operation starts, a record is created.  ur_ingest_session has a foreign key reference to the device table so that the  same device can be used for multiple ingest sessions but also the ingest  sessions can be merged across workstations / servers for easier detection  of changes and similaries between file systems on different devices.                      | table |

If  the session included a file system scan, then root_path is the  root file system path that was scanned. If the session was discovering  resources in another target then root_path would be  representative of the target path (could be a URI).                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | table |

On multiple executions,<br>uniform_resource are inserted only if the the content (see unique<br>index for details). For historical logging, uniform_resource has foreign<br>key references to both ur_ingest_session and ur_ingest_session_fs_path<br>tables to indicate which particular session and ingestion path the<br>resourced was inserted during.                                                                                                                                                      | table |

| [ur_ingest_session_fs_path_entry](ur_ingest_session_fs_path_entry.md)           | 21      | Contains entries related to file system content ingestion paths. On multiple executions,  unlike uniform_resource, ur_ingest_session_fs_path_entry rows are always inserted and  references the uniform_resource primary key of its related content.  This method allows for a more efficient query of file version differences across  sessions. With SQL queries, you can detect which sessions have a file added or modified,  which sessions have a file deleted, and what the differences are in file contents  if they were modified across sessions. | table |
| [ur_ingest_session_task](ur_ingest_session_task.md)                             | 15      | Contains entries related to task content ingestion paths. On multiple executions,  unlike uniform_resource, ur_ingest_session_task rows are always inserted and  references the uniform_resource primary key of its related content.  This method allows for a more efficient query of file version differences across  sessions. With SQL queries, you can detect which sessions have a file added or modified,  which sessions have a file deleted, and what the differences are in file contents  if they were modified across sessions.                 | table |
