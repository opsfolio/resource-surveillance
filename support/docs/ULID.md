## ULID Primary Keys across multiple devices

The ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier) is designed
to generate unique identifiers across distributed systems without coordination.
Let's break down its structure to understand the likelihood of conflicts.

A ULID consists of:

1. A 48-bit timestamp, which gives millisecond precision for about 138 years.
2. A 80-bit random component, which is generated randomly for each ID.

Given the design, there are two primary scenarios where a conflict might arise:

1. **Timestamp Collision**: If two or more ULIDs are generated at the exact same
   millisecond on different machines, then the uniqueness of the ULID is purely
   dependent on the randomness of the second component.
2. **Randomness Collision**: Even if the timestamp differs, if the random
   component generated is the same for two ULIDs (which is astronomically
   unlikely), there will be a conflict.

Now, let's consider the probability of each scenario:

1. **Timestamp Collision**: If you're generating millions of ULIDs in a short
   span of time, it's quite likely that you'll have multiple ULIDs with the same
   timestamp. This isn't a problem by itself, but it means the uniqueness then
   rests on the random component.
2. **Randomness Collision**: The random component of a ULID is 80 bits. This
   means there are \(2^{80}\) or approximately \(1.2 x 10^{24}\) possible
   values. If you generate millions (let's say one million for simplicity), the
   chance of any two having the same random value is tiny. Using the birthday
   paradox as a rough estimation, even after generating billions of ULIDs, the
   probability of a conflict in the random component remains astronomically low.

If you generate millions of ULIDs across multiple machines, the chances of a
collision are extremely low due to the large randomness space of the 80-bit
random component. The design of the ULID ensures that even in high-throughput
distributed systems, conflicts should be virtually non-existent. As always with
such systems, monitoring and conflict resolution strategies are still good
practices, but the inherent risks are minimal.
