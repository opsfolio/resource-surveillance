# use this to test `surveilr ingest tasks` command; for example:
# $ cat support/test-fixtures/synthetic-tasks-via-stdin | surveilr ingest tasks
#
# We use the same library that Deno uses for https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/tools/task_runner.
# See https://github.com/denoland/deno_task_shell.
#
# - one `deno_task_shell` input per line (no newlines allowed in between)
# - blank lines and anything starting with `#` will be ignored
# - if you need more complicated tasks use surveilr _Capturable Executables_ instead of tasks

# [TEXT] run osquery and store results in `uniform_resource` as JSON;
# the `--json` is the instruction for osquery, `surveilr` assumes JSON.
osqueryi "SELECT * from users" --json

# [JSONL] the following is the same as above except it has a name
{ "custom name for task output in uniform_resource": "osqueryi \"SELECT * from users\" --json", "nature": "json" }

# [JSONL] the following is the same as above except we store the result as plain text
{ "osquery result as plain text": "osqueryi \"SELECT * from users\"", "nature": "text/plain" }

# [TEXT] this command should run the same as the first but should not be stored more than once
osqueryi "SELECT * from users" --json
