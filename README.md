  * See https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35816224  (ChatGPT can help too): 
    * https://deno.com/blog/roll-your-own-javascript-runtime
    * https://deno.com/blog/roll-your-own-javascript-runtime-pt2
    * https://deno.com/blog/roll-your-own-javascript-runtime-pt3
  * Another option (not preferred but use if Deno does not work) is or https://crates.io/crates/nickel-lang-core
- [ ] Use https://crates.io/crates/vfs for abstracting file system(s)
  - [ ] https://crates.io/crates/vfs-zip
  - [ ] https://crates.io/crates/vfs-clgit
  - [ ] https://crates.io/crates/vfs-https
- [ ] Use https://crates.io/crates/directories for loading configs, etc. from known locations
